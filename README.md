# Employee-Churn-Analysis-2
# 🏢 Employee Churn Analysis & Prediction using Machine Learning

An end-to-end project aimed at predicting employee churn (attrition) using machine learning models and providing actionable insights to HR departments for improving retention strategies.

## 🚀 Project Overview
- Built machine learning models to predict employee churn based on HR datasets.
- Conducted thorough **EDA** to understand factors influencing attrition.
- Implemented models like **Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, and XGBoost**.
- Evaluated model performance using **Confusion Matrix, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and AUC-ROC curves**.
- Used **SHAP (SHapley Additive Explanations)** for feature importance and explainability.
- Proposed data-driven retention strategies for high-risk employee segments.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools
- **Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, SHAP)**
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** (Data Visualization)
- **Jupyter Notebook** (Development Environment)
- **Excel/CSV HR Datasets**
